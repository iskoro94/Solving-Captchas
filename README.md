# Summary
The goal of this program is to solve CAPTCHAs containing 5 letters or digits that are corrupted in various ways. The data consists of 1070 labeled images, which are split into a training set and a small test set. The model used is a Convolutional Neural Network. The images are first preprocessed to remove as much of the corruption as possible, and then cropped to obtain 5200 images of single symbols. The model is then trained on this data and validated using cross-validation. Finally, the model is used on the test data to visualize the performance of the model.

The model performed well on the test set, having 90%  accuracy. This is higher than expected, probably due to the small size of the test set. The model has a validation accuracy of approximately 93.8% on individual symbols, which gives an expected validation accuracy of 72.6% for the whole CAPTCHA predictions. However, the actual test accuracy could be lower since the validation data was used to tune the hyperparameters of the CNN. 

The performance of the model could be improved in multiple ways. The training set is relatively small, containing only 1040 images, and the performance would increase if more images were used. The cropping function could also be improved, since it struggles with certain letters such as "m", which is much wider than the other symbols in some of the images.
